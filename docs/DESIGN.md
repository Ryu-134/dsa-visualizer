# DSA Visualizer Design Document

## Project Objectives

Goal: to create a web-based application that visualizes the internal workings of various data structures and algorithms (DSA). The project will include:

- Interactive visuals
- Code snippets
- Detailed explanations for educational purposes

### Core Functionality

- Interactive visualization of data structures like Linked Lists, Vectors, etc.
- Step-by-step simulations for operations (e.g., node insertion/removal).
- Display respective code implementations for each visualization.
- Dynamic updates to visualizations based on user input.

---

## User Interface

- Clean and responsive design using Tailwind CSS and CSS Flexbox.
- Mobile-friendly layouts.
- Sections for:
  - Selecting DSAs
  - Viewing visuals
  - Accessing C++ code snippets

---

## Key Components

### Component 1: Home Page
- **Description**: Main landing page with navigation options.

### Component 2: DSA Pages
- **Description**: Dedicated pages for each data structure.

### Component 3: Tabs
- **Description**: Allow users to switch between implementations (e.g., singly or doubly linked lists).

---

## Basic Design (UI/Architecture)

### UI Design
- **Main Page**: Dropdown menu for DSA selection and navigation buttons.
- **DSA Pages**: 
  - Visual representation of DSA
  - Visual representation of Code 
  - User input section for interaction

### Architecture Overview
- **Frontend**: 
  - Built with SvelteKit for reactive UI and state management.
  - TailwindCSS and ShadCn components with animations.
- **Visualization Logic**:
  - D3.js or SVG components for rendering and animating data structures.

---

## Build & Dependency Management Plan

- **Build System**: Vite (integrated with SvelteKit) for fast builds and hot reloading.
- **Dependency Management**:
  - `npm` for JavaScript libraries and frameworks.
  - GitHub Actions for continuous integration.

---

## Testing Plan

- **Unit Testing**: Using Vitest.
- **Integration Testing**: Ensures component and system cohesion.

---

## Future Enhancements Priority:

1. Fix footer text.
2. Convert the entire application to use a Flexbox grid system with media queries for smaller screens.
3. Add more basic DSAs.
4. Add a dropdown menu in the main menu.
5. Introduce a quick-select sidebar once enough DSA routes exist.
6. Add an "About" section.
7. Expand operations per DSA.
8. Provide varying implementations of each DSA (e.g., singly or doubly linked lists).
9. Implement a search bar for specific implementations.
10. Test mobile responsiveness thoroughly using Tailwind CSS.
11. Add animations via GSAP or Svelte.
12. Enhance visuals and consider adding animated backgrounds.
