# DSA Visualizer
---
**DSA Visualizer** is an educational tool designed to visualize data structures and algorithms. Built using **SvelteKit** and **Tailwind CSS**, it provides an interactive and intuitive platform to explore and understand fundamental concepts in computer science.

This project was developed as part of my journey as a Computer Science student, driven by my desire to deepen my understanding of data structures and algorithms while honing my web development skills. 

It aims to make learning DSA concepts engaging, accessible, and practical for a wide audience.
